# TO-DO-LIST-WEBSITE
Project Highlight: To-Do List

Built a simple yet functional to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, which appear as clickable items. On completion, clicking the task moves it to a "Completed Tasks" section—demonstrating DOM manipulation and dynamic UI updates.

🔍 Key Features:
- Users can enter a task and click the "Add Task" button to display it instantly in the to-do list.
- Each task appears as a clickable button, offering a clean and interactive interface.
- Once a task is completed, clicking the task button automatically moves it to the "Completed Tasks" section, providing a seamless user experience.
- It demonstrates real-time updates and element reclassification, showcasing how JavaScript can be used to manage UI state effectively.

This project kickstarted my journey in front-end development and gave me hands-on experience with core web technologies.

“Small steps lead to big changes. Today a to-do list, tomorrow a full-stack masterpiece!” 🌟
